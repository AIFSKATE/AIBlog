This is my Blog(Still Developing). 

My project is built with .NET 8, using ASP.NET Core for the backend and Blazor WebAssembly for the frontend. 

I built my blog by learning from a [tutorial](https://github.com/Meowv/Blog)ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ. But I made some changes based on my own conditions. I chose not to use the ABP framework recommended in the tutorial, because I wanted to work directly with the native features of ASP.NET rather than through an additional framework layer.
